# baking-app
Project 4 of Udacity/Google NanoDegree

For this project, I built a baking app which pulls from an api and displays recipes.
Users can then click on a recipe to view ingredients and steps. Users can also view available videos for steps as well.

These are the technologies that were used to build this app:

- Viewmodel
- ExoPlayer
- Retrofit
- Picasso
- Fragments
- RecyclerView
- Expresso Tests
- Timber

These are the features I implemented:

- Widget that displays a list of ingredients
- Tablet layout
